# LEARNINGCURVE Generates the train and cross validation set errors needed
# to plot a learning curve
#   [error_train, error_val] = ...
#       LEARNINGCURVE(X, y, Xval, yval, lambda) returns the train and
#       cross validation set errors for a learning curve. In particular, 
#       it returns two vectors of the same length - error_train and 
#       error_val. Then, error_train(i) contains the training error for
#       i examples (and similarly for error_val(i)).
#
#   In this function, you will compute the train and test errors for
#   dataset sizes from 1 up to m. In practice, when working with larger
#   datasets, you might want to do this in larger intervals.
