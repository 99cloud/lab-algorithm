# NNCOSTFUNCTION Implements the neural network cost function for a two layer
# neural network which performs classification
#   [J grad] = NNCOSTFUNCTON(nn_params, hidden_layer_size, num_labels, ...
#   X, y, lambda) computes the cost and gradient of the neural network. The
#   parameters for the neural network are "unrolled" into the vector
#   nn_params and need to be converted back into the weight matrices. 
# 
#   The returned parameter grad should be a "unrolled" vector of the
#   partial derivatives of the neural network.

    # ====================== YOUR CODE HERE ======================
    # Instructions: You should complete the code by working through the
    #               following parts.
    #
    # Part 1: Feedforward the neural network and return the cost in the
    #         variable J. After implementing Part 1, you can verify that your
    #         cost function computation is correct by verifying the cost
    #         computed in ex4.m
    #
    # Part 2: Implement the backpropagation algorithm to compute the gradients
    #         Theta1_grad and Theta2_grad. You should return the partial derivatives of
    #         the cost function with respect to Theta1 and Theta2 in Theta1_grad and
    #         Theta2_grad, respectively. After implementing Part 2, you can check
    #         that your implementation is correct by running checkNNGradients
    #
    #         Note: The vector y passed into the function is a vector of labels
    #               containing values from 1..K. You need to map this vector into a 
    #               binary vector of 1's and 0's to be used with the neural network
    #               cost function.
    #
    #         Hint: We recommend implementing backpropagation using a for-loop
    #               over the training examples if you are implementing it for the 
    #               first time.
    #
    # Part 3: Implement regularization with the cost function and gradients.
    #
    #         Hint: You can implement this around the code for
    #               backpropagation. That is, you can compute the gradients for
    #               the regularization separately and then add them to Theta1_grad
    #               and Theta2_grad from Part 2.
