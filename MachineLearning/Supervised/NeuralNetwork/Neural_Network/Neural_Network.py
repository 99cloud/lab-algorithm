# 
#  This file contains code that helps you get started on the
#  linear exercise. You will need to complete the following functions 
#  in this exericse:
#
#     sigmoidGradient.m
#     randInitializeWeights.m
#     nnCostFunction.m
#
#

# # Setup the parameters you will use for this exercise
input_layer_size = 400    # 20x20 Input Images of Digits
hidden_layer_size = 25    # 25 hidden units
num_labels = 10           # 10 labels, from 1 to 10   
                          # (note that we have mapped "0" to label 10)

# # =========== Part 1: Loading and Visualizing Data =============
#  We start the exercise by first loading and visualizing the dataset. 
#  You will be working with a dataset that contains handwritten digits.

# Load Training Data
print('Loading and Visualizing Data ...\n')

data = sio.loadmat('number_data.mat')
X = data['X']
y = data['y'] % 10

# Randomly select 100 data points to display
rand_indices = np.random.permutation(m)

displayData(sel)

# # ================ Part 2: Loading Parameters ================
# In this part of the exercise, we load some pre-initialized 
# neural network parameters.

print('\nLoading Saved Neural Network Parameters ...\n')

# Load the weights into variables Theta1 and Theta2
data = sio.loadmat('weights.mat')
Theta1 = data['Theta1']
Theta2 = data['Theta2']

# Unroll parameters 
nn_params = np.append(Theta1, Theta2)

# # ================ Part 3: Compute Cost (Feedforward) ================
#  To the neural network, you should first start by implementing the
#  feedforward part of the neural network that returns the cost only. You
#  should complete the code in nnCostFunction.m to return cost. After
#  implementing the feedforward to compute the cost, you can verify that
#  your implementation is correct by verifying that you get the same cost
#  as us for the fixed debugging parameters.
#
#  We suggest implementing the feedforward cost *without* regularization
#  first so that it will be easier for you to debug. Later, in part 4, you
#  will get to implement the regularized cost.
#

print('Cost at parameters (loaded from weights): %f \
       \n(this value should be about 0.287629)\n' % J)

# # =============== Part 4: Implement Regularization ===============
#  Once your cost function implementation is correct, you should now
#  continue to implement the regularization with the cost.
#

# Weight regularization parameter (we set this to 1 here).
_lambda = 1

# # ================ Part 5: Sigmoid Gradient  ================
#  Before you start implementing the neural network, you will first
#  implement the gradient for the sigmoid function. You should complete the
#  code in the sigmoidGradient.m file.
#

print('\nEvaluating sigmoid gradient...\n')

g = sigmoidGradient(np.array([1, -0.5, 0, 0.5, 1]))

# # ================ Part 6: Initializing Pameters ================
#  In this part of the exercise, you will be starting to implment a two
#  layer neural network that classifies digits. You will start by
#  implementing a function to initialize the weights of the neural network
#  (randInitializeWeights.m)

initial_Theta2 = randInitializeWeights(hidden_layer_size, num_labels)

# Unroll parameters
initial_nn_params = np.append(initial_Theta1.flatten(), initial_Theta2.flatten())


# # =============== Part 7: Implement Backpropagation ===============
#  Once your cost matches up with ours, you should proceed to implement the
#  backpropagation algorithm for the neural network. You should add to the
#  code you've written in nnCostFunction.m to return the partial
#  derivatives of the parameters.
#
print('\nChecking Backpropagation... \n')

#  Check gradients by running checkNNGradients
checkNNGradients()

input('\nProgram paused. Press enter to continue.\n')


# # =============== Part 8: Implement Regularization ===============
#  Once your backpropagation implementation is correct, you should now
#  continue to implement the regularization with the cost and gradient.
#

print('\nChecking Backpropagation (w/ Regularization) ... \n')

#  Check gradients by running checkNNGradients

# # =================== Part 8: Training NN ===================
#  You have now implemented all the code necessary to train a neural 
#  network. To train your neural network, we will now use "fmincg", which
#  is a function which works similarly to "fminunc". Recall that these
#  advanced optimizers are able to train our cost functions efficiently as
#  long as we provide them with the gradient computations.
#
print('\nTraining Neural Network... \n')

#  You should also try different values of lambda
_lambda = 1

# Create "short hand" for the cost function to be minimized
costFunction = lambda p: nnCostFunction(p,
                                   input_layer_size,

                                   num_labels, X, y, _lambda)

# Now, costFunction is a function that takes in only one argument (the
# neural network parameters)
res = minimize(costFunction, initial_nn_params, method='CG', jac=True, options={'maxiter': 200})
nn_params = res.x

                 hidden_layer_size, input_layer_size + 1)
    
Theta2 = nn_params[hidden_layer_size * (input_layer_size + 1):].reshape(
                 num_labels, hidden_layer_size + 1)

#  You can now "visualize" what the neural network is learning by 
#  displaying the hidden units to see what features they are capturing in 
#  the data.

input('\nProgram paused. Press enter to continue.\n')

# # ================= Part 10: Implement Predict =================
#  After training the neural network, we would like to use it to predict
#  the labels. You will now implement the "predict" function to use the
#  neural network to predict the labels of the training set. This lets
#  you compute the training set accuracy.
