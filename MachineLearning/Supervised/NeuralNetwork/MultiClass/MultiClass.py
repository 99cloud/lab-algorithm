# # Machine Learning: One-vs-all

#  Instructions
#  ------------
# 
#  This file contains code that helps you get started on the
#  linear exercise. You will need to complete the following functions 
#  in this exericse:
#
#     lrCostFunction.py (logistic regression cost function)
#     oneVsAll.py
#     predictOneVsAll.py
#     predict.py
#
#

# # Initialization
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import scipy.io as sio
from scipy.optimize import minimize
from displayData import displayData
from oneVsAll import oneVsAll
from predictOneVsAll import predictOneVsAll

plt.ion()

# # Setup the parameters you will use for this part of the exercise
input_layer_size = 400    # 20x20 Input Images of Digits
num_labels = 10           # 10 labels, from 1 to 10   
                          # (note that we have mapped "0" to label 10)

# # =========== Part 1: Loading and Visualizing Data =============
#  We start the exercise by first loading and visualizing the dataset. 
#  You will be working with a dataset that contains handwritten digits.
#

# Load Training Data
print('Loading and Visualizing Data ...\n')

data = sio.loadmat('number_data.mat')  # training data stored in arrays X, y
X = data['X']
y = data['y'] % 10

m = X.shape[0]

# Randomly select 100 data points to display
rand_indices = np.random.permutation(m)
sel = X[rand_indices[0:100]]

displayData(sel)

input('Program paused. Press enter to continue.\n')

# # ============ Part 2: Vectorize Logistic Regression ============
#  In this part of the exercise, you will reuse your logistic regression
#  code from the last exercise. You task here is to make sure that your
#  regularized logistic regression implementation is vectorized. After
#  that, you will implement one-vs-all classification for the handwritten
#  digit dataset.
#

print('\nTraining One-vs-All Logistic Regression...\n')

all_theta = oneVsAll(X, y, num_labels, _lambda)


input('Program paused. Press enter to continue.\n')

# # ================ Part 3: Predict for One-Vs-All ================
#  After ...
pred = predictOneVsAll(all_theta, X)

print('\nTraining Set Accuracy: %f\n' % (np.mean(np.double(pred == y.T)) * 100))
