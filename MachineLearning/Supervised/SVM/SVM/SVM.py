# # =============== Part 1: Loading and Visualizing Data ================
#  We start the exercise by first loading and visualizing the dataset. 
#  The following code will load the dataset into your environment and plot
#  the data.
#

# Load from data1:
# You will have X, y in your environment

# Plot training data
plotData(X, y.T[0])

# # ==================== Part 2: Training Linear SVM ====================
#  The following code will train a linear SVM on the dataset and plot the
#  decision boundary learned.
#

# Load from data1:
# You will have X, y in your environment
data = sio.loadmat('data1.mat')
X = data['X']

# boundary varies (e.g., try C = 1000)

#  You will now implement the Gaussian kernel to use
#  with the SVM. You should complete the code in gaussianKernel.m
